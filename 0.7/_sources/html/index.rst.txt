In `machine learning <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning>`_, support
vector machine (SVMs), and support vector regression (SVRs) are `supervised learning <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervised_learning>`_
models with associated learning `algorithms <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm>`_
that analyze data and recognize patterns, used for `classification <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_classification>`_
and `regression analysis <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis>`_.  More
generally, machine-learning deals with the construction and study of systems
that can `learn <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning>`_ from data, rather than
follow only explicitly programmed instructions.

Applications for machine learning include:

- `Object recognition <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_recognition>`_
- `Natural language processing <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing>`_
- `Search engines <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engines>`_
- `Bioinformatics <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioinformatics>`_
- `Stock market <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market>`_ analysis
- `Speech <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_recognition>`_ and `handwriting recognition <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_recognition>`_
- `Sentiment analysis <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentiment_analysis>`_
- `Recommender systems <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recommender_system>`_
- `Sequence mining <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_mining>`_, commonly referred as *data mining*
