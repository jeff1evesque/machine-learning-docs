Donations are very appreciated.  Smaller donations, could fund a latt√©, during
a late night meddling code.  While larger donations, could fund further
research, by assisting the cost for the following:

- server(s): this could be made open to the public, and implementing machine-learning.
- peripheral device(s): these device(s) could connect to the machine-learning server(s):
- `raspberry pi <https://www.raspberrypi.org/>`_: these devices could communicate to the machine-learning server(s), or *peripheral device(s)*.
- `xbee chip <www.digi.com/lp/xbee>`_: these chips could implement the `zigbee <http://www.zigbee.org/>`_ wireless protocol, allowing peripheral device(s) to transmit data between one another, and finally to the machine-learning server(s).
- `sensor <http://www.adafruit.com/categories/35>`_: multiple types of sensors could be connected via the `zigbee <http://www.zigbee.org/>`_ wireless protocol to other sensor(s), raspberry pi(s), or directly to the machine-learning server(s).
