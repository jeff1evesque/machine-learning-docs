Machine Learning
================

This site serves as documentation to the programmatic rest-api, as well as the web-interface
for various machine-learning algorithms. Currently there are two algorithms supported:

- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Support Vector Regression (SVR)

Both these options, support various kernel implementations. Additionally, the corresponding
`source code <https://github.com/jeff1evesque/machine-learning>`_, can be further reviewed.
Other algorithms, as well as the UI/UX will be improved with time. However, `pull requests <https://github.com/jeff1evesque/machine-learning/compare>`_,
and related feature `requests <https://github.com/jeff1evesque/machine-learning/issues/new>`_
are welcome.
